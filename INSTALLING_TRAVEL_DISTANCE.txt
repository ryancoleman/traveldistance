0. Systems

All code is developed and tested on GNU/Linux systems, and has been tested 
on recent Mac OS X systems. It may work under cygwin on Windows systems.

1. External Downloads/Installs

The Travel Depth Code relies on Python 2.5 (it may work with 2.6 but is 
untested, a port to the 3 branch is planned). Also, visualization support is 
provided by a python script for PyMOL. CLIPPERS requires numpy or Numeric, 
it is optional for Travel Depth, Burial Depth and CHUNNEL. 

These 3 software packages may be installed on your system already, or if
necessary, download and install them here:

http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.2/

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=1351

http://pymol.sourceforge.net/

You must set the $TDHOME environmental variable to this directory (the 
directory with bin/ and src/ among others.

The included python scripts run using the python2.5 command. You must have 
this set and in your path unless you want to call each script by saying 

`/path/to/python2.5 $TDHOME/src/tstTravelDepth.py file.pdb`

for instance. Again, if you've set python2.5 to call the correct 
interpreter, you can just run the scripts like this:

`$TDHOME/src/tstTravelDepth.py file.pdb`

Before running these scripts, you must also install the required software.

2. Quickhull

Quickhull or qhull is redistributed here, available at
http://www.qhull.org as well, and it is required for the Travel Depth
code to run. If using the supplied version, install as follows:

`cd $TDHOME/qhull/src`
`make install`

$TDHOME/bin/qhull is the qhull executable, other qhull executables are also
placed there. 

An alternative code khull is under development and included since qhull 
does not work on some 64 bit linux installations. khull is compiled in the 
next step, after completing the compilation you can rename khull to qhull 
in the $TDHOME/bin directory. Alternatively, you can change the flag in 
tstConvexHull.py on line 12 to runKHull=True.

3. Surface Generation code (TST)

Travel Depth can work with any triangulated surface, but currently
support only for surfaces generated with the included code and the 'tst'
file format. Install as follows:

`cd $TDHOME/tst`
`make all`

Which compiles and puts the executables into ./bin 

4. If you want to analyze CLIPPERS data, you will most likely need to 
install aiSee. aiSee is free for academic use and can be downloaded from:

http://www.aisee.com/download/

For almost any operating system. aiSee imports .gdl files, which are 
created by CLIPPERS as described in the RUNNING_TRAVEL_DISTANCE.txt file.

5. All python scripts are are in pymol/ or src/, and need no
installation, unless you want to add the directories to your path or run
the tstdisp.py script everytime PyMOL starts.

There are several scripts to run, described in the 
RUNNING_TRAVEL_DISTANCE.txt file
